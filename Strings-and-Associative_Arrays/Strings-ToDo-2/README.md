# Strings Algorithm Todo 2
２０２３年０８月１３日（日）

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript **String** algorithms to perform various tasks. Each algorithm is briefly explained below:

## 1. Reverse

Implement **`reverseString(str)`** that, given string, returns that string with characters reversed.

Given "**creature**", return "**erutaerc**". Tempting as it seems, do not use the built-in `reverse()`!


## 2. Remove Even-Length Strings

Build a standalone function to remove strings of *even lengths* from a given array. For array containing

`["Nope!","Its","Kris","starting","with","K!","(instead","of","Chris","with","C)","."]`, change that same array to `["Nope!","Its","Chris","."]`.


## 3. Integer to Roman Numerals

Given a positive integer that is less than 4000, return a string containing that value in Roman numeral representation. In this representation, **I** is 1, **V** is 5, **X** is 10, **L** = 50, **C** = 100, **D** = 500, and **M** = 1000. Remember that 4 is IV, 349 is CCCIL and 444 is CDXLIV.


## 4. Roman Numerals to Integer

Sept 16, 2014 headline: “_Ancient Computer Found in Roman Shipwreck_”. Comprising 30 bronze gears, its wooden frame features 2000 characters. Given a string containing a Roman numeral representation of a positive integer, return the integer. Remember that **III** is **3**, **DCIX** is **609** and **MXDII** is **1492**.
