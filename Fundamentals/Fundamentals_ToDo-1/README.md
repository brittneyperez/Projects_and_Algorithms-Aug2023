# Fundamentals Todo 1
２０２３年０８月０３日（木）

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript algorithms to perform various tasks. Each algorithm is briefly explained below:

## 1. Setting and Swapping
Set `myNumber` to 42. Set `myName` to "Bri". Then swap `myNumber` into `myName` & vice versa.


## 2. Print -52 to 1066
Using FOR, print multiples of 3 from -300 to 0. Skip -3 and -6.

## 3. Don't Worry, Be Happy
A function `beCheerful` logs "Good morning!" 98 times using a `for` loop.

## 4. Multiples of Three - But Not All
This code prints multiples of 3 from -300 to 0, skipping -3 and -6, using a `for` loop and `continue` statement.

## 5. Printing Integers with While
A `while` loop prints integers from 2000 to 5280, inclusive.

## 6. You say It's Your Birthday
A function `sayItsMyBday` takes two parameters (month and day) in either order and checks if they match the birth month and day. If so, log "How did you know?", else log "Just another day...."

## 7. Leap Year
A function `checkIfLeapYear` checks if a given year is a leap year based on the provided criteria. If a year is divisible by four, it is a leap year, unless it is divisible by 100. However, if it is divisible by 400, then it is.

## 8. Print and Count
This algorithm prints all multiples of 5 between 512 and 4096 and counts the total occurrences.

## 9. Multiples of Six
Using a `while` loop, this code prints multiples of 6 from 6 to 60,000.

## 10. Counting, the Dojo Way
This algorithm uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 0 to 100. It prints "Coding" for multiples of 5, "Coding Dojo" for multiples of 10.

## 11. What do you know?
A function `logIncomingValue` logs the value of the input parameter `incoming`.

## 12. Whoa, That Sucker's Huge...
This code uses a `for` loop to sum all odd integers from -300,000 to 300,000.

## 13. Countdown by Fours
A `while` loop counts down by fours from 2016, excluding 0.

## 14. Flexible Countdown
Based on earlier “Countdown by Fours”, `given lowNum`, `highNum`, `mult`, print multiples of `mult` from `highNum` down to `lowNum`, using a FOR. For (2,9,3), print 9 6 3 (on successive lines).

## 15. The Final Countdown
This is based on “Flexible Countdown”. The parameter names are not as helpful, but the problem is essentially identical; don’t be thrown off! Given 4 parameters (`param1`,`param2`,`param3`,`param4`), print the multiples `of param1`, starting `at param2 and` extending `to param3`. One exception: if a multiple is equal `to param4`, then skip (don’t print) it. Do this using a WHILE. Given (3,5,17,9), print 6,12,15 (which are all of the multiples of 3 between 5 and 17, and excluding the value 9).
